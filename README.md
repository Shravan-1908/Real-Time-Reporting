# Way-Ahead
Some advanced level python projects here!
1. News Reporter - A real time news reporting python file. (You'll need an API key from NewsAPI to run this program.)
2. Weather Monitor - A real time weather reporter. (Again, you'll need the key from WeatherAPI.)
3. Library Manager - A library managing system made possible with object oriented programming.
4. Bike Rental System - A full-fledged bike rental system implemented in Python using object oriented programming.
5. Desktop Assistant - An ultimate desktop assistant that make your life easy by automating some silly, daily tasks. Well it's AI but without ML. (To use this, you need to - install some external modules - speechrecognition, pyaudio, pyttsx3, wikipedia, pyautogui. Also I've imported news_reporter module (find it above) for real time news + snake_water_gun and guess_the number from my another repo The_Leap. Also give URLs and application paths for the repective sites/apps.)
